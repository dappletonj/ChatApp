# ChatApp

# Overview

For this project I created a messaging app to allow communication between two users. The user will be able to login into their account
and see the previous messages that they have sent. The messages will be private to the specific user so no other user will be able to
login and see another message that another user has sent.

The purpose for this project is to simulate one of the most popular activities in the world, that is texting. I have always been interested
in how they were able to accomplish this activity between two computers, and in this project I learn the ins and outs of sending and receiving
text messages.

# Development Environment

For this project I have created a messaging app using Kotlin in Android Studio. Kotlin is a open-source, statically-typed
programming language that supports both object-oriented and functional programming. Kotlin provides similar syntax and concepts
from other languages, including C#, Java, and Scala, among many others.
